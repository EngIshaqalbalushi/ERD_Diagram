# 🗺️ ERD and Mapping - Database Design Project

This project demonstrates how to design a relational database using an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and map it into relational schemas. The focus is on identifying entities, relationships, attributes, and then converting the ERD into normalized SQL tables using mapping rules.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram based on real-world scenarios
- Identify entities, relationships, attributes, and cardinalities
- Apply ERD to relational schema mapping rules
- Generate SQL table creation scripts from the ERD
